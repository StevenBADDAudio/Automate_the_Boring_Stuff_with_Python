#In this chapter, we used the dictionary value 
# {'1h': 'bking', '6c': 'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop', 
# '5h': 'bqueen', '3e': 'wking'}
# to represent a chess board. Write a function named 
# isValidChessBoard() that takes a dictionary argument
# and returns True or False depending on if the board 
# is valid.
#A valid board will have exactly one black king and 
# exactly one white king. Each player can only have at 
# most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and
#all pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; 
# that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'. The piece 
# names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent 
# white or black, followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 
# 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'. This function
# should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper
# chess board.
